Review:
So I went and saw IT, and came back unimpressed. I mean it was a good movie, no doubt about that.
 A bunch of kids, outcasts in their own right, being terrorized by an ancient demon that plays upon 
the fears of its victims is pretty much the standard in Hollywood horror movie territory. All the kids are well cast,
 the script is funny and tight, and there are plenty of monster shots. The cinematography is great, 
the pace is even and the CGI is flawless. But is more funny than terrifying- it's R rating more a 
justification of teenage slang in the script, rather than for true scares.
