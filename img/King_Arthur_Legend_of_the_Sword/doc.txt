M Desc.
Acclaimed filmmaker Guy Ritchie brings his dynamic style to the epic fantasy action adventure "King Arthur: 
Legend of the Sword." Starring Charlie Hunnam in the title role, the film is an iconoclastic take on the classic
Excalibur myth, tracing Arthur's journey from the streets to the throne. When the child Arthur's father is murdered,
Vortigern (Jude Law), Arthur's uncle, seizes the crown. Robbed of his birthright and with no idea who he truly is, 
Arthur comes up the hard way in the back alleys of the city. But once he pulls the sword from the stone, 
his life is turned upside down and he is forced to acknowledge his true legacy...whether he likes it or not.


Short Describe:

Robbed of his birthright, Arthur comes up the hard way in the back alleys of the city. 
But once he pulls the sword from the stone, 
he is forced to acknowledge his true legacy - whether he likes it or not.

Review:

I have to say that I found it truly awful in almost every respect.
It had clearly cost a bit of money to make, and it does use some quite fancy computer-produced action graphics,
but this doesn't compensate for a boring and badly told story-line - with some of the most pathetic dialogue you are ever likely to hear. 
To make matters worse, none other than David Beckham manages to show up (as himself it seems) somewhere in the middle to spout some garbage.
Even those who can claim to have some acting credentials fail to make their words worth listening to.
