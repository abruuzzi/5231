Review:

This movie is much better than the previous 2. In fact, this movie should be used as "foot" to develop true sequels of the same quality as this, and even better.
Rarely nowadays you can see a movie that is entertaining from the beginning to the end and with all the condiments you could imagine of a great movie. 
This movie reaches all those levels. And if you do not like it, I honestly could not understand why.
It is moving, has action, has good CGI, good rhythm ... and all that works cohesively to fit in to a very good argument.
What more can I say.
Only those who can truly appreciate this film, forgetting their prequels, only appreciating this ... will understand.
